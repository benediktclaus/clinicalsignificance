# Analyzing Clinical Significance: The Anchor-Based Approach

## Introduction

The anchor-based approach is one of the most intuitive methods for
evaluating clinical significance. It answers a straightforward question:
**“Did the patient’s change on an outcome measure meet or exceed a
predefined threshold for what is considered meaningful?”**

This threshold is known as the **Minimal Important Difference (MID)**.
The MID is the smallest change in a score that patients perceive as
beneficial. It serves as an external “anchor” to determine if an
observed change is practically relevant.

This vignette will guide you through using the
[`cs_anchor()`](https://benediktclaus.github.io/clinicalsignificance/reference/cs_anchor.md)
function to perform both individual- and group-level analyses using this
approach.

``` r
library(clinicalsignificance)
```

## Individual-Level Analysis

At the individual level, we classify each participant based on whether
their change score crosses the MID.

### A Basic Example

We will use the `claus_2020` dataset, which contains data from a study
on enhancing the placebo effect of antidepressants. The primary outcome
was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), where lower scores indicate
improvement. For the BDI-II, a change of **7 points** is often
considered the MID.

The `claus_2020` dataset has four measurements per patient. For a
pre-post analysis, we must specify which time points to compare using
the `pre` and `post` arguments.

``` r
# Analyze individual change from the first to the fourth measurement
anchor_individual <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 7
  )

# Print the summary table
anchor_individual
#> 
#> ---- Clinical Significance Results ----
#> 
#> Approach:          Anchor-based
#> MID Improvement:   7
#> MID Deterioration: 7
#> Better is:         Lower
#> 
#> Category     |  N | Percent
#> ---------------------------
#> Improved     | 25 |  62.50%
#> Unchanged    | 11 |  27.50%
#> Deteriorated |  4 |  10.00%
```

The output shows that 62.5% of patients were classified as “Improved”
(their BDI-II score decreased by 7 points or more), 27.5% were
“Unchanged”, and 10% “Deteriorated”.

### Visualizing Individual Change

A clinical significance plot helps visualize these results. Each point
represents a patient.

- **Solid Diagonal Line**: No change (`pre` = `post`). Points below this
  line represent improvement for the BDI-II.
- **Shaded Area**: The zone of “no meaningful change”. Its boundaries
  are `post = pre ± MID`.
- **Points below the shaded area**: Clinically significant improvement.
- **Points above the shaded area**: Clinically significant
  deterioration.

``` r
plot(anchor_individual)
#> Ignoring unknown labels:
#> • colour : "Group"
```

### Analyzing by Group

The `claus_2020` study included a Treatment as Usual (TAU) group and a
Placebo-Amplification (PA) group. We can analyze the clinical
significance for each group by specifying the `group` argument.

``` r
anchor_grouped <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 7,
    group = treatment
  )

# Print results by group
summary(anchor_grouped)
#> 
#> ---- Clinical Significance Results ----
#> 
#> Approach:          Anchor-based
#> MID Improvement:   7
#> MID Deterioration: 7
#> N (original):      43
#> N (used):          40
#> Percent (used):    93.02%
#> Better is:         Lower
#> Outcome:           bdi
#> 
#> Group |     Category |  N | Percent | Percent by Group
#> ------------------------------------------------------
#> TAU   |     Improved |  8 |  20.00% |           42.11%
#> TAU   |    Unchanged |  7 |  17.50% |           36.84%
#> TAU   | Deteriorated |  4 |  10.00% |           21.05%
#> PA    |     Improved | 17 |  42.50% |           80.95%
#> PA    |    Unchanged |  4 |  10.00% |           19.05%
#> PA    | Deteriorated |  0 |   0.00% |            0.00%

# Plot results by group
plot(anchor_grouped)
```

![](anchor-based-approach_files/figure-html/individual-grouped-1.png)
The plot clearly shows that more patients in the PA group (yellow
points) achieved a clinically significant improvement compared to the
TAU group (blue points).

### Handling “Positive” Outcomes

Some instruments measure constructs where higher scores are better
(e.g., quality of life). For these, we must set `better_is = "higher"`.
Let’s analyze the `who` (WHO-5 Well-Being Index) outcome from the same
dataset, assuming an MID of 4.

``` r
anchor_positive <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = who,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 4,
    better_is = "higher"
  )

plot(anchor_positive)
#> Ignoring unknown labels:
#> • colour : "Group"
```

![](anchor-based-approach_files/figure-html/positive-outcome-1.png) Now,
points *above* the shaded area represent clinically significant
improvement.

## Group-Level Analysis

The anchor-based approach can also be applied at the group level to
determine if the *average* change for a group was clinically meaningful.
[`cs_anchor()`](https://benediktclaus.github.io/clinicalsignificance/reference/cs_anchor.md)
uses a Bayesian framework by default to generate a credible interval for
the mean difference.

We set `target = "group"` to perform this analysis.

### Within-Group Analysis

First, let’s assess the average change within each treatment group
separately.

``` r
anchor_group_within <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 7,
    target = "group",
    group = treatment
  )

anchor_group_within
#> 
#> ---- Clinical Significance Results ----
#> 
#> Approach:        Anchor-based (within groups)
#> MID Improvement: 7
#> Better is:       Lower
#> 
#> Group | Median Difference |  Lower | Upper | Ci Level |  N |                            Category
#> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#> TAU   |             -4.24 |  -9.12 |  0.62 |     0.95 | 19 |       Statistically not significant
#> PA    |            -13.62 | -18.11 | -9.21 |     0.95 | 21 | Large clinically significant effect
```

The results indicate that the TAU group’s change was not statistically
significant, while the PA group showed a “Large clinically significant
effect” because its entire 95% credible interval for the mean change was
beyond the MID of -7.

### Between-Group Comparison

Perhaps the most common use case is comparing the change in an
intervention group relative to a control group. We can do this by
setting `effect = "between"`. The function will calculate the difference
in change scores between the groups.

``` r
anchor_group_between <- claus_2020 |> 
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    post = 4, # Only post is needed here, as we compare change scores
    mid_improvement = 7,
    target = "group",
    group = treatment,
    effect = "between"
  )

anchor_group_between
#> 
#> ---- Clinical Significance Results ----
#> 
#> Approach:          Anchor-based (between groups)
#> MID (Improvement): 7
#> Better is:         Lower
#> 
#> Group 1 | Group 2 | Median Difference |  Lower | Upper | Ci Level | N 1 | N 2 |                               Category
#> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#> TAU     |      PA |            -10.23 | -18.28 | -2.75 |     0.95 |  19 |  21 | Probably clinically significant effect
```

The analysis shows a “Probably clinically significant effect” in favor
of the PA group. The average difference between the groups exceeded the
MID, but the MID was still within the 95% credible interval.

## Summary and Next Steps

The anchor-based approach provides a highly interpretable assessment of
meaningful change, but its use depends on having a well-established MID
for your outcome measure.

- Use
  [`cs_anchor()`](https://benediktclaus.github.io/clinicalsignificance/reference/cs_anchor.md)
  for **individual-level** analysis to classify each patient as
  improved, unchanged, or deteriorated.
- Use `cs_anchor(target = "group")` for **group-level** analysis to
  assess if the average change was meaningful.

When an MID is not available, other methods are required. The next
vignette explores the **distribution-based approach**, which assesses
whether a change is statistically reliable and larger than what might be
expected from measurement error alone.
