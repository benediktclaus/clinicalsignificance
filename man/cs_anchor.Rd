\arguments{
\item{data}{A tidy data frame}

\item{id}{Participant ID}

\item{time}{Time variable}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable}

\item{group}{Grouping variable (optional)}

\item{pre}{Pre measurement (only needed if the time variable contains more
than two measurements)}

\item{post}{Post measurement (only needed if the time variable contains more
than two measurements)}

\item{mid_improvement}{Numeric, change that indicates a clinically
significant improvement}

\item{mid_deterioration}{Numeric, change that indicates a clinically
significant deterioration}

\item{better_is}{Which direction means a better outcome for the used
instrument? Available are
\itemize{
\item \code{"lower"} (lower outcome scores are desirable, the default) and
\item \code{"higher"} (higher outcome scores are desirable)
}}
