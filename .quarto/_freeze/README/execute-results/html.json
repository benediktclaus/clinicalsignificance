Each approach answers a specific question:\n\n* **`cs_anchor()`**: *Did the patient improve by a minimal amount?* Evaluates change based on a predefined **Minimal Important Difference (MID)**.\n* **`cs_percentage()`**: *Did the patient improve by a certain percentage?* Assesses change relative to the baseline score.\n* **`cs_distribution()`**: *Is the change reliable (beyond measurement error)?* Uses statistical distribution metrics like the **Reliable Change Index (RCI)**.\n* **`cs_statistical()`**: *Did the patient return to a functional range?* Determines if a patient moved from a clinical to a **functional population**.\n* **`cs_combined()`**: *The \"Gold Standard\" (e.g., Jacobson & Truax).* Combines reliability and cutoff criteria for a robust assessment.\n\n## 📦 Installation\n\nInstall the stable version from CRAN:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"clinicalsignificance\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nOr the development version from GitHub:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"benediktclaus/clinicalsignificance\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 🚀 Example: The Combined Approach\n\nLet's look at the **combined approach** (Jacobson & Truax, 1991). We want to know if patients in the `claus_2020` dataset (included in the package) showed a **reliable change** AND moved into a **functional population** range.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(clinicalsignificance)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# 1.
