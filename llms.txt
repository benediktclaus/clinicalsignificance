# clinicalsignificance

The **clinicalsignificance** R package provides a comprehensive and
consistent framework for analyzing **clinical significance** in
intervention studies. While *statistical* significance only indicates
whether an effect is unlikely due to chance, clinical significance
addresses the crucial question: Does an intervention lead to a
**practically relevant or meaningful change** for the individual
patient?

This package is designed to help researchers and healthcare
professionals assess the practical relevance of their findings and make
more informed decisions.

## Core Functions

The package implements the most common methods for clinical significance
analysis, each accessible through its own main function:

- [`cs_anchor()`](https://benediktclaus.github.io/clinicalsignificance/reference/cs_anchor.md):
  Evaluates change based on a predefined **minimal important difference
  (MID)**.
- [`cs_percentage()`](https://benediktclaus.github.io/clinicalsignificance/reference/cs_percentage.md):
  Assesses the **percentage change** relative to the baseline score.
- [`cs_distribution()`](https://benediktclaus.github.io/clinicalsignificance/reference/cs_distribution.md):
  Determines if a change is **statistically reliable** and exceeds
  measurement error (e.g., using the Reliable Change Index, RCI).
- [`cs_statistical()`](https://benediktclaus.github.io/clinicalsignificance/reference/cs_statistical.md):
  Determines if a patient has moved from a **clinical to a functional
  population**.
- [`cs_combined()`](https://benediktclaus.github.io/clinicalsignificance/reference/cs_combined.md):
  Combines multiple approaches (e.g., distribution-based and
  statistical) for a more rigorous and nuanced assessment.

## Installation

You can install the stable version of **clinicalsignificance** from
CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("clinicalsignificance")
```

Or, install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("benediktclaus/clinicalsignificance")
```

## Example: A Combined Approach

Let’s demonstrate its use with the `Claus et al. (2020)` study included
in the package. We will use the combined approach by Jacobson & Truax
(1991), which assesses if a change is both reliable and crosses the
cutoff into a functional population.

For this, we need descriptive data from a functional (non-clinical)
population for the instrument used (BDI-II) and a reliability estimate.

``` r
library(clinicalsignificance)
library(ggplot2)

# Perform the analysis using the combined approach
results_combined <- claus_2020 |>
  cs_combined(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    reliability = 0.801,
    m_functional = 7.69,
    sd_functional = 7.52,
    cutoff_type = "c"
  )

# Display a summary of the results

#> Deteriorated |  0 |   0.00%
#> Harmed       |  0 |   0.00%

# Visualize the results
plot(results_combined, show_group = "category")
```

![](reference/figures/README-example-1.png)

The plot shows each patient as a point. The categories are clearly
visible: - **Recovered**: Patients whose change was reliable AND who
moved into the functional population range post-treatment. -
**Improved**: Patients whose change was reliable but who remained within
the clinical range. - **Unchanged**: Patients with no reliable change. -
**Deteriorated**: Patients with a reliable worsening of symptoms.
