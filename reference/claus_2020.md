# Placebo Amplification Data

A dataset containing the data from Claus et al. (2020). In a routine
inpatient setting for unipolar depressive disorders they implemented an
intervention that sought to amplify the placebo response of
antidepressants. In the study, two groups were compared: treatment as
usual (TAU) and placebo amplification (PA). Participants were examined
four times during their treatment.
