## Details

In a fictional clinical trial, participants were split up to belong to
either a medical placebo ("Placebo") or psychotherapeutic intervention
("Intervention") group.

They underwent outpatient treatment during which they were followed for
5 measurements at which a fictional anxiety score was measured. This
anxiety score may range from 0 - 60.

The functional population (i.e., non-anxious individuals) can be
expected to have a mean score of M = 8 points with a standard deviation
of SD = 4.
