The **clinicalsignificance** R package provides a comprehensive and consistent framework for analyzing **clinical significance** in intervention studies. While *statistical* significance only indicates whether an effect is unlikely due to chance, clinical significance addresses the crucial question: Does an intervention lead to a **practically relevant or meaningful change** for the individual patient?

This package is designed to help researchers and healthcare professionals assess the practical relevance of their findings and make more informed decisions.

## Core Functions

The package implements the most common methods for clinical significance analysis, each accessible through its own main function:

* `cs_anchor()`: Evaluates change based on a predefined **minimal important difference (MID)**.
* `cs_percentage()`: Assesses the **percentage change** relative to the baseline score.
* `cs_distribution()`: Determines if a change is **statistically reliable** and exceeds measurement error (e.g., using the Reliable Change Index, RCI).
* `cs_statistical()`: Determines if a patient has moved from a **clinical to a functional population**.
* `cs_combined()`: Combines multiple approaches (e.g., distribution-based and statistical) for a more rigorous and nuanced assessment.

## Installation
You can install the stable version of **clinicalsignificance** from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("clinicalsignificance")
```

Or, install the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("benediktclaus/clinicalsignificance")
```

## Example: A Combined Approach

Let's demonstrate its use with the `Claus et al. (2020)` study included in the package. We will use the combined approach by Jacobson & Truax (1991), which assesses if a change is both reliable and crosses the cutoff into a functional population.

For this, we need descriptive data from a functional (non-clinical) population for the instrument used (BDI-II) and a reliability estimate.

```{r example, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
library(clinicalsignificance)
library(ggplot2)

# Perform the analysis using the combined approach
results_combined <- claus_2020 |>
  cs_combined(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    reliability = 0.801,
    m_functional = 7.69,
    sd_functional = 7.52,
    cutoff_type = "c"
  )

# Display a summary of the results
summary(results_combined)

# Visualize the results
plot(results_combined, show_group = "category")
```

The plot shows each patient as a point. The categories are clearly visible:
- **Recovered**: Patients whose change was reliable AND who moved into the functional population range post-treatment.
- **Improved**: Patients whose change was reliable but who remained within the clinical range.
- **Unchanged**: Patients with no reliable change.
- **Deteriorated**: Patients with a reliable worsening of symptoms.
