The goal of this package is to provide all necessary tools for analyses of clinical significance in clinical intervention studies. In contrast to *statistical* significance, which assesses if it is probable that there is a treatment effect, *clinical* significance can be used to determine if a treatment effect is of practical use or meaningful for patients.

## Installation
You can install clinicalsignificance from CRAN and the development version from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("clinicalsignificance")

# Or you install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pedscience/clinicalsignificance")
```



## Example
Given a tidy dataset, the employed instrument's reliability and a minimal important difference for that instrument, a clinical significance analysis can be calculated with the following function call.

```{r example}
library(clinicalsignificance)

results <- claus_2020 |>
  cs_anchor(
    id = id,
    time = time,
    outcome = bdi,
    pre = 1,
    post = 4,
    mid_improvement = 7
  )

results
```

You can receive a detailed summary of the analysis by

```{r}
summary(results)
```

or plot the results with

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
plot(results)
```
